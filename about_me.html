        <p>My name is Sebastian Pizzuto, I am am a <a href=https://harrington.uri.edu/academics/film-media-b-a/>Film/Media major</a> at the University of Rhode Island. 
                  I also plan on majoring in Computer Science as well. My dream is to be able to work on films, like the MARVEL superhero films. One day, I want to
                  make my own movie that I write and direct. </p>
                         
               <p>Some of my passtimes are skiing, biking, playing videogames and hanging out with my friends. I also enjoy photography 
                  and swimming. I am on the <a href="https://web.uri.edu/clubsports/msw/"> URI Club Swimming and Dive team</a>. I joined last year, 
                  and now I am the photographer for the club team.</p>
